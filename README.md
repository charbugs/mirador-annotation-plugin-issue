This Repo shows an issue with the [mirador-annotations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mirador-annotations) plugin.

When you load Mirador with the mirador-annotations plugin and another plugin that wraps the window component than the the window starts flickering when the annotation panel is open.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
